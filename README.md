# Kaggle-Overfit-Comp
<h1>Kaggle Competition to avoid overfitting</h2>

This report is the process that was untaken to create the model that was entered into the Kaggle competition,"Don't Overfit".The premise of the competition is stated below :

    "we have 20,000 rows of continuous variables, and a mere handful of training samples. Once again, we challenge you not to overfit. Do your best, model without overfitting, and add, perhaps, to your own legend."

The basic structure of this report will consist of :
<ul>
  <li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
    <li>Exploring the Features Correlation</li>
    <li>Creating a scoring function</li>
    <li>Basic Modelling</li>
    <li>Experimenting with the model - Feature selection</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

From an initial look, we can see the following information :
<ul>
    <li>Dataset contains Interval Data.</li>
    <li>It has 300 features and only 250 records</li>
    <li>There is an imbalance in the classification of 16/25</li>
    <li>There is no missing Data</li>
 </ul>
